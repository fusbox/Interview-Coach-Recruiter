## Goals & Motivations
 
### Primary Goals
1. **Place candidates faster**: Reduce time-to-fill by having prepared candidates
2. **Reduce no-shows and poor screenings**: Candidates who ghost or bomb screening calls waste time
3. **Differentiate from competitors**: Offering prep tools makes [Company] stand out to candidates
4. **Hit metrics**: Placements, submittals, client satisfaction scores
 
### What Success Looks Like
> "I sent the candidate the practice link yesterday. When I called her today, she was articulate, had her elevator pitch ready, and knew what questions to expect. The client loved her. That's a win."

## Pain Points & Frustrations
 
| Pain Point | Frequency | Severity |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Candidates unprepared for screening calls | Daily | High |
| No-shows or last-minute cancellations | Weekly | High |
| Time spent coaching basic interview skills | Daily | Medium |
| No visibility into candidate prep level | Always | Medium |
| Candidates nervous/inarticulate on calls | Daily | Medium |
 
### Underlying Frustrations
- "I don't have time to hand-hold every candidate through Interview 101"
- "I wish I knew which candidates actually prepared vs. just said they would"
- "Some candidates have great experience but can't talk about it"
- "I'm competing with other firms for the same candidates—I need an edge"

## Behaviors & Workflow
 
### How This Tool Fits In
 
**Trigger**: Recruiter identifies a promising candidate who needs to prep for a screening
**Action**: Sends practice interview invite via email/text
**Timing**: 1-3 days before scheduled screening call
**Follow-up**: Reviews candidate's completion status and results before the call
 
### Decision Criteria for Adoption
- **Must be fast**: "If it takes more than 2 minutes to set up, I won't use it"
- **Must be easy to share**: "I need to copy a link and paste it in an email"
- **Must show results**: "I want to see if they actually did it and how they did"
- **Must help candidates**: "If candidates hate it, it hurts my relationship with them"

## Key Scenarios
 
### Scenario 1: Regular Use
Riley has a screening call tomorrow with Jordan. They:
1. Log into the tool
2. Create an invite for a "Customer Service" role
3. Copy the link
4. Paste it into an email to Jordan with a note: "Complete this before our call"
5. Next day: Check if Jordan completed it and review highlights
 
### Scenario 2: Reviewing Results
Before a screening call, Riley opens the tool to see:
- Did the candidate complete the practice?
- How did they perform overall?
- Any specific strengths or areas of concern?
- Key talking points to explore in the real screening

## Design Implications
 
| Insight | Design Implication |
|---------|-------------------|
| Time-constrained | Invite creation < 2 minutes |
| Needs quick status checks | Dashboard shows completion at a glance |
| Wants to help, not test | Position as "practice" not "assessment" |
| Mobile status checks | Mobile-responsive recruiter view |
| Shares via email/text | Easy copy-paste invite links |
| Distrusts complex tools | Progressive disclosure, simple defaults |

## Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)
 
### Primary JTBD
**When** I have a screening call scheduled with a candidate,
**I want to** send them a quick, effective way to practice,
**So that** they show up prepared and I can assess their real potential.
 
### Secondary JTBD
**When** I'm deciding which candidates to submit to a client,
**I want to** see which ones took preparation seriously,
**So that** I can prioritize candidates who are invested in the opportunity.
