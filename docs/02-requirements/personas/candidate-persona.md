## Key Scenarios
 
### Scenario 1: First Impression
Jordan receives an email from their recruiter with a link:
> "Complete this practice interview before our call on Thursday. It'll help you prepare and only takes 15 minutes."
 
Jordan's thoughts:
- "Is this legit or spam?"
- "Do I have to create an account?"
- "What will this actually do?"
- "Will the recruiter see everything I say?"
 
**Design need**: Clear, trustworthy landing page with expectations set upfront.
 
### Scenario 2: Mobile Completion
Jordan opens the link on their phone during lunch break:
- Has 20 minutes
- In a semi-public space (can't talk loudly)
- Needs to use text input instead of voice
- Gets interrupted once, needs to resume
 
**Design need**: Mobile-optimized, text fallback, save progress.
 
### Scenario 3: Technical Trouble
Jordan's microphone doesn't work:
- Gets frustrated
- Doesn't know how to fix it
- Might abandon the session
 
**Design need**: Graceful degradation to text, clear troubleshooting.

## Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)
 
### Primary JTBD
**When** I have a screening call coming up,
**I want to** practice answering interview questions with feedback,
**So that** I feel prepared and make a good impression.
 
### Secondary JTBD
**When** I don't know what questions to expect,
**I want to** see realistic examples of what I'll be asked,
**So that** I'm not caught off guard during the real call.

## Accessibility Considerations
 
Candidates may have:
- **Visual impairments**: Screen reader compatibility, sufficient contrast
- **Hearing impairments**: Text alternatives, visual feedback indicators
- **Motor impairments**: Keyboard navigation, large touch targets
- **Cognitive considerations**: Clear language, simple navigation, no time pressure
- **Situational limitations**: Noisy environment (text input), bright sunlight (contrast)
 
These aren't edge cases—they're part of the candidate population.
