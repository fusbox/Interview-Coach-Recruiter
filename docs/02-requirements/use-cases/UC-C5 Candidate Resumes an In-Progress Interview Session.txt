# Use Case: Candidate Resumes an In-Progress Interview Session

## Use Case ID
UC-C5

---

## Summary
A candidate resumes an in-progress interview session so they can continue without losing progress, regardless of refresh, device change, or temporary disconnection.

---

## Primary Actor
Candidate

---

## Secondary Actors
- System (Projection / Resume Logic)
- Client Local Storage

---

## Preconditions
- A valid session exists and is accessible by the candidate.
- Session status is not terminal (e.g., not permanently completed or archived).

---

## Trigger
Candidate opens or refreshes the session link for an existing session.

---

## Main Success Scenario
1. Candidate accesses the session using the invite link.
2. System validates access and resolves the session.
3. System returns the canonical `/now` projection for the session.
4. Client reconciles server-provided state with any local draft content.
5. Client renders the current session state (question, draft, eval status).
6. Candidate continues the session from the exact point they left off.

---

## Postconditions
- Candidate is positioned at the correct session state and question index.
- Draft content is restored accurately.
- No duplicate generation or evaluation is triggered.

---

## Alternate / Error Scenarios

### A1 — Session Already Completed
**Scenario:** Candidate attempts to resume a completed session.  
**System behavior:**
- System returns a read-only projection or completion message per policy.
- Candidate is not allowed to modify session state.

---

### A2 — Local Draft Conflict
**Scenario:** Local draft differs from server draft.  
**System behavior:**
- System and client apply deterministic reconciliation rules (e.g., latest revision wins).
- Candidate is never shown partial or conflicting content.

---

### A3 — Expired or Invalid Token
**Scenario:** Session token is expired or invalid.  
**System behavior:**
- System denies access safely without leaking session details.

---

## System Responsibilities
- Provide a single authoritative projection for resume (`/now`).
- Support deterministic reconciliation between client and server state.
- Avoid unintended state transitions on resume.
- Preserve all persisted work.

---

## Non-Responsibilities
- The system does not restart sessions automatically.
- The system does not regenerate content on resume.
- The system does not infer candidate intent from resume behavior.

---

## Relevant Architecture Contracts
- `04-architecture/state-and-streaming-contract.md`
- `04-architecture/api-surface.md`
- `04-architecture/stability-and-change-policy.md`

---

## Notes
- Resume behavior is the most frequently exercised path and must be treated as a primary success criterion.
- Any changes to resume semantics require a formal gate decision due to their impact on trust and reliability.
